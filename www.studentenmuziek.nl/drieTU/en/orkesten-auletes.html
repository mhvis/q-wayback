 	  <h1>Auletes</h1>
      <p>Auletes is a sub-society of the Eindhoven Student Music Society Quadrivium. Quadrivium was founded in 1964 and consists of a mixed choir, a chamber orchestra, a recorder ensemble and a wind orchestra. Besides, the association has members who only use the rehearsal rooms and pianos, the so-called 'piano members'. Quadrivium is the Latin word for 'crossroads' and refers to the medieval academic education, which consisted of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy.
The wind orchestra Auletes is the largest sub-society of ESMG Quadrivium. Approximately once every year, Auletes engages in a large project with a full-evening concert. Recent successes are performances of Orff's Carmina Burana and The Queen Symphony by Kashif.</p>

In 2005, Jos started his second phase studies in brass ensemble conducting at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague, which he finished in 2008. In the meantime, Jos participated in several master classes and private lessons with a.o. Maurice Hamers, Valery Gergiev, Alex Schillings, Heinz Friesen, Norbert Nozy, Hans Leenders and Jan Cober.
