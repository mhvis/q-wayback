<h3>Children and aids</h3>
<div class="columnFotoRechts" style="width:196px">
<img src="../images/goededoel2.jpg" alt="Stille slachtoffers als gevolg van aids en HIV in Afrika" /></div><p>So many children  are victims of Aids. Not only because they may suffer from the disease itself,  but also because they lost their parents to the disease. As a consequence, they  find themselves alone in the world. Every year Aids kills two million people.  Especially in Africa, HIV/Aids is a big problem. Especially the children who  are left behind are the silent victims. They’re often infected by their parents  or lose their parents to the disease, and with that the base to live a normal  life. 3FM asks your attention, and drives for funds  in cooperation with the Red Cross, for these  children, for this silent disaster.</p>
<h3>Children and HIV</h3>
<p>HIV/Aids kills two million people annually and  that means that it kills most people of any disease worldwide. As one more sad  consequence of the disease, many parents die, or are unable to take care of  their children, and many children are infected or end up on the streets. After  the death of their parent(s) children often end up alone because gradparents,  aunts and uncles or neighbours are to poor or too old to take care of them. Often  in such situation, it’s the oldest child in the family who is burdened with the  care for their brothers and sisters.  <br /></p>

<h3>Red Cross intervenes</h3>
<p>There were children cannot be adopted by the communion,  they are left to themselves. The Red Cross takes care of these children, and helps  them acquire the basic needs, like fresh water, food and clothes. Besides that,  the organization gives psychosocial aid and home aid. The Red Cross helps  children with finding health care support and taking medication.</p>
<h3>Offering a future</h3>
<p>  The Red Cross wants to ensure that these children receive a  good future and therefore offers schooling, books, school uniforms and tuition.  Many of the foster families can’t afford this. Girls  often have to take care of the remainder of the family (the other children) and  can’t go to school. 3FM and the Red Cross want to offers as many of a these  children a brighter future.<br />
  As a neutral  organization the Red Cross can offer help in areas which are not accessible to  most humanitarian aid organization. Therefore the International Red Cross can  reach the most vulnerable people. All over the world, the Red Cross gives helps  directly.</p>
